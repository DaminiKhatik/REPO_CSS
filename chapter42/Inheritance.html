        <h3>Automatic inheritance</h3>
        <p>Inheritance the a fundamental mechanism of CSS by which the computed values of some properties of an element
            are applied to its' children. This is particularly useful when you want to set a global style to your elements rather
            than having to set said properties to each and every element in your markup.
            Common properties that are automatically inherited are: font, color, text-align, line-height.
            </p>
       </div>
       <br>
    <h3> Enforced inheritance</h3>
    <div id="css1"><p>Some properties are not automatically inherited from an element down to its' children. This is because those
        properties are typically desired to be unique to the element (or selection of elements) to which the property is
        applied to. Common such properties are margin, padding, background, display, etc.
        However, sometimes inheritance is desired anyway. To achieve this, we can apply the inherit value to the property
        that should be inherited. The inherit value can be appied to any CSS property and any HTML element.</p></div>
