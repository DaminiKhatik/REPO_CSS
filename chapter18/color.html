    <h2>currentColor</h2>
    <div>In this case, specifying currentColor for the border is most likely redundant because omitting it should produce

    <p id="one">CSS colors may also be represented as a hex triplet, where the members represent the red, green and blue
        components of a color.</p>

            <h3>rgb() Notation</h3>
            <p class="three">RGB is an additive color model which represents colors as mixtures of red, green, and blue light. In essence, the
                RGB representation is the decimal equivalent of the Hexadecimal Notation. In Hexadecimal each number ranges
                from 00-FF which is equivalent to 0-255 in decimal and 0%-100% in percentages.</p>

<h3>hsl() Notation
</h3>
<p class="seven">HSL stands for hue ("which color"), saturation ("how much color") and lightness ("how much white").</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>: hsla() Notation</h3>
<p class="eight">Similar to hsl() notation, but with an added alpha (opacity) value.</p>
